3. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?\
**Answer**: Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) Frameworks- Cucumber, JBehave are some of the popular open source BDD frameworks available. The main reason of using a BDD framework is that it enables a Non-tech users like (BA, Managers etc) to understand what the automation scripts does. Because of the simplicity it offers to the end users, many businesses are moving towards BDD.
3. How would you approach adding automated testing to an existing (web) application with no existing E2E tests? Have you ever had to do this?\
**Answer:** I will start with automating the most important manual test cases (modify few things to fit in an automated scenario) that tests stuff in the application, that is not too likely to change over time. If no manual test cases i will start with document first.
